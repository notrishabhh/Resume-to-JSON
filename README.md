# Resume-to-JSON
PDF to JSON Conversion Script
I developed a Python script to automate the conversion of resume information from PDF format into a structured JSON format. This script leverages the PyPDF2 library for extracting text from the PDF and then processes this text to generate a well-organized JSON representation.

Key Features:
PDF Parsing: Utilizes PyPDF2 to read and extract text from PDF files.
Structured Output: Converts the extracted text into a JSON format, maintaining sections such as "Name", "Contact Information", "Summary", "Education", "Skills", "Experience", "Projects", "Certifications", "Achievements", "Interests", and "Personal Details".
Automation: Simplifies the process of extracting and structuring resume information, making it easier to use in various applications and databases.
